        <details open>
            <summary>Main Topic</summary>
            <p>The main topic of this website is to provide people with a free tool to convert "boring" and difficult to
                read text into a fun slideshow presentation using artificial intelligence and text to speech software
            </p>
        </details>

            <summary>Main Objectives</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a means for users to enter their text</li>
                <li>Use a a DALL-E backend to generate images from text</li>
                <li>Convert text into image based slideshow</li>
                <li>Narrate text and switch between slides</li>
                <li>Allow users to save narrated slideshow as a mp4</li>
                <li>Allow users to export the slideshow as a powerpoint file</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

            <summary>Target Audience</summary>
            <p>The target audience for Presently is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students</li>
                <li>Teachers</li>
                <li>Dyslexics</li>
                <li>Visually Impaired</li>
                <li>Employees who need to make a lot of slideshows</li>
                <li>Those who have difficulty reading long texts</li>
                <li>Lazy people like me!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The target audience was determined based on who seemed most likely to want or need to convert a text
                document into an audio/visual project, but lacks the skills or the time to do so using traditional
                software solutions like powerpoint. It also seems likely that this will be useful for business uses, as
                one can simply write about a given topic and have it quickly converted into a slideshow/video
                presentation without much effort.</p>

            <summary>Content</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Content for this site will be generated based on user input using a DALL-E backend. Dall-E was
                    chosen specifically due to its' ability to synthesize new artwork from text
                </li>
                <li>
                    Graphical icons are going to be provided by bootstrap's open-source library because they are free
                    and have a uniform design to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The text to speech software I will be using for reading out the script is Google's TTS API because I
                    find it to be one of the more natural sounding text-to-speech tools out there, and it is designed to
                    work in the browser client-side as well which will make implementing it easier.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <summary>Initial Design Idea & Content</summary>
            <p>The design of this site should be fairly simple, intuitive, and minimalist. The goal is to have a basic
                web application that
                users can sign up for. I like the idea of using a black/dark theme, but I think I may allow that to be
                customizable to suit user preference.
                Content will be user-generated, as I said we will be using DALL-E mini to generate images based on what
                the AI thinks is being talked about
                in the text. These images will then be added to a slideshow which will be read aloud by google's text to
                speech API.
