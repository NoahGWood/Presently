                <p>The main topic of this website is to provide people with a free tool to convert "boring" and difficult to read text into a fun slideshow presentation using artificial intelligence and text to speech software</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a means for users to enter their text</li>
                    <li>Allow users to provide a DALL-E backend to generate images from their text</li>
                    <li>Convert text into image based slideshow</li>
                    <li>Narrate text and switch between slides</li>
                    <li>Allow users to save narrated slideshow as a mp4</li>
                    <li>Allow users to export the slideshow as a powerpoint file</li>
                    <li>Do this all client side because life isn't difficult enough</li>

                <summary>Target Audience</summary>
                <p>The target audience for Presently is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students</li>
                    <li>Teachers</li>
                    <li>Dyslexics</li>
                    <li>Visually Impaired</li>
                    <li>Employees who need to make a lot of slideshows</li>
                    <li>Those who have difficulty reading long texts</li>
                    <li>Lazy people like me!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The target audience was determined based on who seemed most likely to want or need to convert a text document into an audio/visual project, but lacks the skills or the time to do so using traditional software solutions like powerpoint. It also seems likely that this will be useful for business uses, as one can simply write about a given topic and have it quickly converted into a slideshow/video presentation without much effort.</p>

                        Content for this site will be generated based on user input using a DALL-E backend. Dall-E was chosen specifically due to its' ability to synthesize new artwork

                        Graphical icons are going to be provided by bootstrap's open-source library because they are free and have a uniform design to them.

                        The text to speech software I will be using for reading out the script is Google's TTS API because I find it to be one of the more natural sounding text-to-speech tools out there, and it is designed to work in the browser client-side as well which will make implementing it easier.
