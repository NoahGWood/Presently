            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;The internet has come a long way since its inception in the late 1960s. What started as a
                way for the US
                military to share information between computers has grown into a global network that is used by billions
                of people every day. The World Wide Web, or the web for short, is a system of interconnected documents
                that can be accessed via the internet. <a onclick="OpenReferences('galileoRef')"><i>(Galileo,
                        n.d.)</i></a>
                The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
                    Berners-Lee</a>, a
                nuclear physicist who was working at <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch/">CERN.</a> at the time. <a

            <summary>Trouble In The Early Days</summary>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;By the mid 1990's, the world wide web was taking off, and along with this novel technology
                came the
                infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars"><strong>Browser Wars</strong></a> that
                took place between Netscape's Navigator Browser and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Each company, trying
                to outdo one another, kept adding on features such as the now-deprecated <blink>Blink</blink> tag.<a
                    onclick="OpenReferences('mozillaRef')"><i>(Mozilla, n.d.)</i></a> This
                'war' got so out of hand that Microsoft actually placed a giant <strong>e</strong> statue in
                front
                of the entrance to Netscape's headquarters, to which Netscape responded by <a
                    href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/stomps.html">defacing the
                    statute</a> and placing their own company mascot on top of it. <a
                    onclick="OpenReferences('strackRef')"><i>(Strack, 1997)</i></a>

            </figure>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;While this is a bit comical, all things considered, the real effect was much worse. Web
                developers had to
                support both browsers, each of which had competing features. Netscape provided users with the ability to
                use javascript, one of the most important programming languages in web development today, and allowing
                us to create responsive websites. Windows, however, provided us with cascading style sheets to make our
                websites look much nicer. At the time you could only use one or the other. This, along with the every
                increasing amount of functions that web developers had to support and the emergence of still even more
                browsers, it became apparent that something had to be done to standardize the web.<a

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;During the Browser Wars in 1994, Tim Berners-Lee left CERN and joined with MIT to found the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. <a
                    onclick="OpenReferences('bernersRef')"><i>(Berners-Lee, 2022)</i></a> The mission of W3C is to
                create a set of standards known as Web
                Standards. Web Standards are the guidelines that govern the design and development of websites.
                These standards are driven by the need to ensure that websites are accessible to everyone regardless of
                device, operating system, or browser. Without these standards it is up to the browser developers to
                create standards for the web browser which makes it much more difficult for web developers to
                create websites that work in all browsers. Simplicity, interoperability, and accessibility are the key
                principles that guide the development of web standards. <a onclick="OpenReferences('w3cRef')"><i>(W3C

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Websites have a few design principles which assist developers in creating sites that comply
                with
                the W3C standards. Doing this ensures that everyone will be able to access your website, regardless of
                browser or device.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;The latest trend in web-development is towards the development of mobile-first websites.
                From Progressive Web Apps to Accelerated Mobile Pages, the focus is on mobile devices for the
                foreseeable future of the web. In the early days of computing, all the work was done on the server, but
                as the technology continues to evolve, we will likely see more and more of the work offloaded onto the
                client's browser.<a onclick="OpenReferences('gmiRef')"><i>(GMI, n.d.)</i></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;For me, personally, I'd like to see more integration between the web and generic programming
                languages such as Python and C. I won't have to wait long though, thanks to HTML5 we now have
                WebAssembly which can be used to do things like embed games written in C# into a website. This
                integration is still a far cry from being able to interact with the user's computer as if the code was
                native, but we are taking steps in the right direction.<a

<template id="mobileFirst">
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Mobile First design is a variation on <a onclick="changeTemplate('responsive',this);">Responsive
            Design</a> which takes into account the fact that most people now access the internet from their
        smartphones. By focusing on making your site look nice on mobile, you are ensuring accessibility to those using
        mobile devices. It is much easier to make a site that is designed with mobile in mind work on a larger screen,
        such as a laptop or browser, than it is to make a website designed for desktop users work well on small mobile
        screens such as cell phones.
    </p>
</template>
<template id="responsiveTemplate">
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Responsive Design are techniques that allow websites to adapt to the screen size of the device that
        is being used to view it. This is important because it ensures that websites can be viewed on any device, from
        smartphones to desktop computers.

<template id="futureTemplate">
    &emsp;&emsp;Future-Friendly design is an approach that takes into account the ever-changing nature of the web.
    Design decisions
    made today may not be good decisions in the future. To address that, Future-Friendly Design focuses on ways to make
    it easy to stand the test of time and allow you to update and change your website as the web evolves. By using the
    other methods of design mentioned here, you will make your website more future proof. Still, more techniques can be
    done, such as by implementing the website logic using micro-services which allow you to quickly swap different
    components in and out of your site with is. <a onclick="OpenReferences('frostRef')"><i>(Frost et al., 2012)</i></a>

        &emsp;&emsp;Progressive Enhancement & Adaptive Web Design is the opposite of <a

<template id="gracefulTemplate">
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Graceful Degradation refers to the ability of a website to continue to function even if some of its'

        has a safe 'fallback' mode for legacy browsers, you are also ensuring that your users will not be adversely
