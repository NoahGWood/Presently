            &emsp;&emsp;An organization developing a site similar to presently will almost certainly find themselves having to design a website for <strong>responsiveness</strong> and <strong>accessibility.</strong> The major issue they would have in designing a <strong>responsive</strong> website would be in ensuring the page looks nice on all screen sizes. This can be accomplished by the use of <strong>CSS Media Queries</strong> to alter the <strong>stylesheet</strong> based on the width or height of the screen. It will be important to design for the smallest screen you want to support, and this can easily be done by using your browser <strong>development tools</strong> such as responsive design mode to try out your site with different screen sizes. Designing for every possible screen size is a bit tedious, instead it’s better use the <strong>min-width</strong> or <strong>max-width</strong> attributes to set the CSS for a range of screen sizes that a given <strong>styling</strong> works well on. <strong>Accessibility</strong> is another important aspect that they would want probably to focus on to ensure that everyone can use their site. One way they should do this is through the use of <strong>semantic tags</strong> such as the <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> tags. Using <strong>web accessibility checkers</strong> along with <strong>semantic validators</strong> from <strong>W3C</strong> are a great way to identify problems they may come across.

            &emsp;&emsp;One of the hardest parts of designing a website is <strong>laying out</strong> the site. We often know generally what pages we want and might need, but without a solid blueprint to follow it is difficult to anticipate what we might need to code to accomplish our task. Using <strong>wireframing</strong> is a great way to help developers on a team know what to code, and it also helps to organize ones’ thoughts on the general look and feel of the website. Similarly, a general outline or <strong>content map</strong> of the site is also helpful in helping us to plan out what pages we are going to need, what copywriting we need to do, and what we should make a priority. The <strong>content map</strong> tells us what content the pages will have while the <strong>wireframes</strong> tell us how that content should be displayed. Another great idea, which I did not do for my site, is to make multiple <strong>wireframes</strong> for both the desktop and mobile browsing experience. Doing this will make it easier to develop a <strong>responsive</strong> website that works well in both desktop and mobile devices.
